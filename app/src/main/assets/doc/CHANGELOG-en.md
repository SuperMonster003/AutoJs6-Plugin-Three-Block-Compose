# v1.9.0

###### 2026/10/22

* `Hint` Several 1.9.0 features need a newer AutoJs6 6.8.0 build: dialogs, the back key, pause and resume, status bar colors and the busy main thread limit in the interactive preview need host commit 2d7944d10 or later (preview contract v4), and running TSX scripts in the interactive preview needs host commit 204a33ee5 or later (preview contract v5) with TypeScript Engine 0.7.0 or later installed. With an older AutoJs6 these features do not appear and the interactive preview works as in 1.8.0 (hiding the designer stops the script and coming back runs it again); TSX UI projects can be tried in AutoJs6 with "Run"
* `Hint` Editing UI layouts in TSX scripts needs TypeScript Engine 0.7.0 or later; without it such projects open as read-only source
* `Feature` The interactive preview is closer to a real run: dialogs the script opens show inside the canvas and can be tapped; a new "Back key" button above the canvas goes to the open dialog first, then to the script's back_pressed event, and ends the run if neither handles it; hiding the designer sends the script pause and it keeps running, and coming back sends resume instead of running it again; status bar and navigation bar colors set by the script show as bars at the top and bottom of the canvas
* `Feature` New "Busy main thread limit" in the "Designer" group of the settings page (1 - 60 s, 5 s by default): when a script in the interactive preview keeps AutoJs6's main thread busy longer than this (an endless loop, say), AutoJs6 stops it and its line shows above the canvas and in the console, so the designer never freezes
* `Feature` UI layouts in TSX scripts: the JSX layouts in ui.layout(...) or ui.inflate(...) of a .tsx script that starts with "ui"; can be edited on the canvas, with the same palette, property drawer and problems tab as JS UI projects; layouts that are not edited stay as they are, edited ones are rewritten in one consistent format; a new UI project can put its layout "In a TSX script"
* `Feature` Event stubs in TSX layouts are written so that TypeScript compiles them: a click becomes onClick={() => { ... }} on the element, other events add (ui as any).<id>.on(...); TSX UI projects still go to AutoJs6 as .tsx files to run or export
* `Feature` TSX UI projects work in the interactive preview too: AutoJs6 compiles the script with TypeScript Engine first, and the canvas says so meanwhile; when compiling fails, the first error shows above the canvas with its line, and a tap lists every error in the console; the lines of errors during the run are lines of the TSX text
* `Feature` Compose interfaces in UI projects can be edited directly: an interface attached to a <compose> container with compose.attach(ui.<id>, ...) is drawn on the canvas where the container is, and its nodes can be selected; the drawer then switches to the Compose panels (properties, slots and state), "Back to the layout" returns to the layout panels, and the State tab changes preview values of compose.state; these edits share the layout's undo history, and saving rewrites only the second argument of compose.attach and leaves the rest of the script as it was
* `Feature` New "Compose" category in the palette: one step adds a <compose> container and its compose.attach call (in a form TypeScript compiles, in TSX scripts), starting with a Column that holds a text, and opens it for editing; it can be undone and goes into the file only when saved
* `Fix` In Arabic, "3-Block Compose" in the titles of the designer home and the gallery and in texts no longer shows as "Block Compose-3"
* `Fix` In Arabic, code in the gallery examples and in the designer's source view, consoles, outline and property fields is now laid out left to right, so semicolons no longer jump to the start of lines and long lines are no longer cut off
* `Improvement` "Preview differences" follow what the installed AutoJs6 supports: with an AutoJs6 that has preview contract v4, dialogs, status bar colors, lifecycle events and endless loops on the main thread are no longer listed, and the note on ui.emitter now says the preview only receives create, resume, pause and back_pressed
* `Improvement` A <compose> container without a height of its own takes the height of its interface in the layout preview, and the elements below it move down as in a real run
* `Dependency` Upgrade the ui-preview-api.aar contract artifact to ui preview contract v5 (v4 adds dialogs, lifecycle events, window colors and the busy main thread limit, v5 adds TSX runs and compile errors; AutoJs6 builds with v3 or older keep the earlier previews)

# v1.8.0

###### 2026/10/16

* `Hint` Several 1.8.0 features need a newer AutoJs6 6.8.0 build: previews that use the project's files (res/ resources, layout files) need host commit 9df0a154b or later (preview contract v3), and running or importing folder projects in AutoJs6 needs host commit faf412ef7 or later; with an older AutoJs6 the designer says so and keeps the earlier behavior
* `Feature` UI (XML) projects can keep their layouts in separate XML files: ui.layoutFile("...") and ui.inflate(files.read("...")) with a literal path, in AutoJs6 XML or Android XML (ui.useAndroidLayout); the designer reads and edits these files and leaves what is not edited untouched, and the fragment switcher lists them by file name
* `Feature` "Save as XML file" and "New XML file" in the menu beside the fragment switcher: the first moves a layout written directly in ui.layout(...) or ui.inflate(...) into a file and rewrites the call, the second adds a file with an empty root container (AutoJs6 XML or Android XML) and a ui.inflate line at the end of the script; both can be undone and write files only when saved
* `Feature` Folder projects: a private project saved with layout files becomes a folder with main.js, its layout files and a project.json AutoJs6 accepts, so AutoJs6 can run and package it as a project; a new UI project can also start as such a folder (AutoJs6 XML or Android XML template); the home list shows folder projects as "name/"
* `Feature` Folder projects export as one zip, and the home menu imports zips and folders ("Import script or zip", "Import folder")
* `Feature` "Run in AutoJs6" and "Import into AutoJs6 scripts" hand a project with layout files to AutoJs6 as a zip: AutoJs6 runs it as a project from a cache folder that is removed afterwards, or imports it into a folder of the same name and asks whether to overwrite it or save as a new folder when that exists
* `Feature` Scripts opened from the AutoJs6 editor can read and write layout files in their own folder: the first time, choose the script's folder in the system folder picker; the access is kept
* `Feature` Android XML layouts are edited against what AutoJs6 actually supports: the property drawer lists each view class's settable android: / app: attributes and the parent layout's parameters, ids are written as @+id/..., the palette inserts Android view classes, and the problems tab flags attributes AutoJs6 ignores or cannot set
* `Feature` The problems tab of UI projects lists "preview differences": lines of the script that behave differently in the preview than in AutoJs6 (activity, ui.emitter, window functions, dialogs, endless loops on the main thread and more), each with its line and an explanation; a tap opens the documentation; they do not count as errors
* `Improvement` The layout preview and the interactive preview give AutoJs6 the project's files, so layouts can use strings, colors, dimensions, styles, images and `<include>` layouts from res/, and ui.layoutFile works in the interactive preview (needs preview contract v3); with an older AutoJs6 the problems tab notes that the preview may differ from a real run
* `Improvement` Inserting an element into a container that holds only whitespace no longer leaves a blank line
* `Dependency` Upgrade the ui-preview-api.aar contract artifact to ui preview contract v3 (adds request keys for a project's resources with a layout and for a project zip with a run; AutoJs6 builds with v2 or v1 only keep the earlier previews)

# v1.7.0

###### 2026/10/15

* `Hint` The interactive preview of UI (XML) projects now has AutoJs6 run the whole script for real (needs an AutoJs6 6.8.0 build with preview contract v2, host commit 4c332c2053 or later, and Android 13 or later): the script's side effects are the same as when run in AutoJs6, and each project asks once before the switch goes on; where the conditions are not met the row above the canvas says why and "Run in AutoJs6" remains
* `Feature` Interactive preview of UI (XML) projects: with the "Interact" switch above the canvas on, AutoJs6 runs the whole script as a ui mode run, the canvas shows the script's ui.layout and takes taps and touches directly, and event handlers, {{ }} bindings, timers and the other modules run with the script's real logic; the script runs again about 0.4 s after edits, stops when the switch goes off, the designer goes to the background or the editor closes, and the canvas returns to the layout preview; the document, the project file and the draft are never changed. On Android 13 - 14 input fields in the canvas take no keyboard input, from Android 15 they do
* `Feature` During the interactive preview the console tab of a UI project shows the output of the script AutoJs6 runs (colored by level), the run's state and its exit reason; when the script fails, the error (with its line) shows above the canvas and a tap opens the console; the run appears under the project's file name in the AutoJs6 running list and can be stopped from there
* `Fix` The designer sometimes showed "The AutoJs6 preview service is not available right now (at most 2 sessions per client)" when opening a UI project: while the canvas size changed twice before the layout settled, the plugin created the preview session in AutoJs6 twice and hit the per-client session limit; now one session is created at a time and the size or appearance that changed meanwhile is applied afterwards
* `Dependency` Upgrade the ui-preview-api.aar contract artifact to ui preview contract v2 (appends, after v1, the interfaces to run and stop a script and the console / error / exit callbacks; AutoJs6 builds with v1 only still provide the layout preview)

# v1.6.0

###### 2026/10/15

* `Hint` The designer gains UI (XML) projects: classic "ui" mode scripts (E4X XML layouts) can be opened and edited, with the canvas drawn by AutoJs6. The layout preview needs an AutoJs6 6.8.0 build that contains the preview service (host commit 306a8f7834 or later); from Android 11 (API 30) the canvas embeds the real views AutoJs6 draws, older versions show a bitmap snapshot; without the service the project can still be edited and the canvas says why
* `Feature` The designer supports UI (XML) projects: pick "UI (XML)" when creating a project, or import a "ui" mode script or open one from the AutoJs6 editor / a file manager and it is read as a UI project; the home list marks each project JS / TSX / UI. The XML layouts of the script are kept as a syntax tree with positions: untouched parts (whitespace, comments, attribute order, quotes, {expressions}) are preserved byte for byte, and only edited start tags, text and newly inserted elements are rewritten; the script's other XML literals can be switched onto the canvas as well
* `Feature` The UI project editor: outline (collapse, move up / down, delete, long-press drag, a switcher when there are several layouts), property drawer (tag, id, text content, the attributes already set and the catalog attributes grouped by View class, text / `{{ }}` binding / {expression} states, bare attributes, any attribute name), component palette (the documentation's 48 tags by category with default attributes), bindings panel (the evaluated values of `{{ }}` names and overrides that touch only the canvas), problems list (checked against the documentation site's tag and attribute catalog) and console (what AutoJs6 reported while drawing the layout); save, draft recovery, source sync, run, open in the AutoJs6 editor, import into the AutoJs6 script directory, copy and export work for UI projects too
* `Feature` The canvas of a UI project is drawn by AutoJs6 (layout preview): the plugin hands the XML fragment and the binding values to the AutoJs6 preview service, AutoJs6 creates real views with its ui mode layout inflater and draws them back onto the canvas without running the project's script; selection and drag work on the canvas as usual, and a failed frame points at the element at fault; the preview runtime shows up as "3-Block Compose preview" in the AutoJs6 running list and can be stopped there
* `Feature` The property drawer of a UI project adds events to the selected element: a `ui.<id>.on('event', ...)` handler stub is appended after the ui.layout call (an element without an id gets one), and the body is written in the script editor; events the script already registers show as "Handled in the script"
* `Dependency` Add the ui-preview-api.aar contract artifact (AutoJs6 ui layout preview contract v1), through which the designer asks AutoJs6 to draw the canvas of UI projects

# v1.5.1

###### 2026/10/15

* `Fix` The plugin could close unexpectedly when a new text field appeared on the designer canvas, for example when inserting a text field from the component palette, when undo / redo brought a text field back, or when a script in the interactive preview showed one (since 1.4.0); such text fields now appear normally
* `Fix` Complete translations for the key heading in the designer inspector

# v1.5.0

###### 2026/10/14

* `Hint` The designer's interactive preview now runs a JavaScript project's script (Android 8.0 or later). The script runs inside the plugin in a restricted sandbox: it can use compose, console, toast and timers only, cannot reach Java / Android or other AutoJs6 modules, and changes only the canvas, never the project. TSX projects and devices below Android 8.0 keep the previous interactive preview
* `Feature` The interactive preview runs the script: with Interact on, a JavaScript project's render function and event handlers really run, so tapping buttons, typing and flipping switches update the canvas the way the script decides; the State panel's preview values become the states' initial values, and the script starts again after the project or a preview value changes
* `Feature` New Console tab: shows what the script writes with console / log, its toasts and its errors in the preview; a script error appears at the bottom of the canvas and opens the console when tapped; a run longer than about 3 seconds (an endless loop, for example) stops the script with the reason, and the designer itself stays responsive
* `Feature` The Interact switch shows a running icon while the script runs
* `Fix` In edit mode a text field on the canvas could take focus by itself and raise the keyboard over the panels (mostly on Android 7.x); components on the canvas no longer take focus in edit mode, and leaving the interactive preview hides the keyboard

# v1.4.0

###### 2026/10/13

* `Hint` TSX projects in the designer need TypeScript Engine 0.7.0 or later; without it, or with an older version, a TSX project can only be viewed and copied as read-only source
* `Feature` The designer supports TSX projects: a new project can be JavaScript or TSX, .tsx files can be imported or opened straight from the AutoJs6 editor and file managers; the TSX source is parsed by TypeScript Engine and edited on the canvas, and saved as TSX in one consistent format (4-space indentation, single-quoted attributes, one child element per line); code the designer cannot edit (such as alias tags, or children made by conditions or loops) is kept as written, and code it cannot represent (such as XML tags and spread attributes) is refused with a line and column
* `Feature` "Run" on a TSX project in the designer hands the project file to AutoJs6, which compiles it with TypeScript Engine and runs it; unsaved changes are saved first
* `Feature` When TypeScript Engine is not installed, too old, or its parsing service is temporarily unavailable, the designer shows the TSX project's source read-only with the reason, and the source can be copied or the parse retried; returning to the designer after installing or updating TypeScript Engine retries automatically
* `Fix` Saving an external script that cannot be written back made the designer crash instead of saving it as a project when the file name contained spaces, parentheses or other characters a project name cannot hold; such characters are now replaced with "-", and imported scripts are named the same way
* `Improvement` Event handlers edited in a TSX project are syntax-checked by TypeScript Engine, so TypeScript syntax such as type annotations can be used
* `Dependency` Add the typescript-parser-api.aar contract artifact (TypeScript syntax tree parsing contract v1), used by the designer to read TSX projects

# v1.3.0

###### 2026/10/13

* `Feature` Designer projects created with "Import script" can use "Write back to source" and "Re-import from source" in the editor menu: the import keeps access to the source file when its provider allows it, either action asks first when the other side changed since the last sync, and a source that can no longer be opened can be picked again to restore the link; saving a project never writes the source by itself
* `Feature` The designer canvas previews Image pictures: '@drawable/name' comes from the installed AutoJs6, and relative paths are looked up in the folder chosen with "Image folder" in the editor menu (read-only access is kept); URLs and absolute paths stay placeholders with the reason in the issues list
* `Feature` The designer editor has a new State panel: it lists the script's top-level compose.state declarations with their initial values and lets you set preview values that change only the canvas, never the script, and add no undo step. With Interact on (top right of the canvas) the components on the canvas can be operated, and switches, sliders, text fields, selections, pagers and other controls bound to a state change its preview value (the script's event handlers do not run); turning it off brings back selecting and dragging
* `Fix` When a child near the start of a container was inserted, removed or moved elsewhere, the children after it were rebuilt from scratch and lost their own state (such as the scroll position of a LazyColumn); they now keep their state and are no longer rebuilt
* `Fix` After changing the text of a text field (TextField / OutlinedTextField) in the designer's property drawer, the field on the canvas kept showing the old text
* `Improvement` Long-press dragging a node on the designer canvas shows an insertion line along the target container's layout (vertical, horizontal or grid) and drops the node where the pointer is, instead of always at the end of the container
* `Improvement` AndroidView on the designer canvas now shows a tinted placeholder that keeps its size modifiers (such as h and fillMaxWidth) and displays the source of its view expression
* `Improvement` The modifier chain in the designer's property drawer can be reordered by dragging the handle on the left of each operation, with an insertion line until it is released; the move up / down buttons remain
* `Improvement` Open popup components (open is true) are now drawn close to their real look inside the designer canvas's logical screen: AlertDialog and ModalBottomSheet cover the page with a scrim, DropdownMenu and Tooltip appear below or above their anchor, and the nodes inside them can be tapped to edit; they are no longer inserted into the page as cards and no real window opens
* `Improvement` After each edit the designer canvas recomposes only the nodes that changed and records node positions more cheaply, so a larger document (about 250 nodes) redraws noticeably faster after undo / redo

# v1.2.0

###### 2026/10/13

* `Hint` The plugin is renamed from Compose UI to 3-Block Compose: the application ID changes from io.github.supermonster003.autojs6.plugin.compose.ui to io.github.supermonster003.autojs6.plugin.three.block.compose. Android treats it as a new app, the old package can stay installed alongside, settings and authorizations are not migrated, and the new package must be enabled and authorized again in the plugin center
* `Hint` Requires an AutoJs6 6.8.0 host build that contains the new plugin identity (host commit f12665ffde or later); earlier hosts discover the plugin by the old package name and do not recognize this version
* `Hint` The designer is documented on the "3-Block Compose Designer" page of the documentation site; the AutoJs6 editor menu entry "Open in 3-Block Compose designer" needs an AutoJs6 6.8.0 build after host commit db7e6a1734, while the other destinations only need an installed AutoJs6
* `Feature` Visual designer: the launcher opens the designer home, where script projects in private storage are created, imported or opened; the editor offers a real-renderer preview canvas, an outline tree, a component palette and a property drawer, with tap to select, long-press drag to reparent, reordering in the outline, undo / redo, automatic draft saving and recovery, host option editing, a contract-catalog validation report, and copying the script or sending it to AutoJs6; in landscape and on tablets the canvas and the panels sit side by side; the component gallery and settings now open from the designer home
* `Feature` Designer and AutoJs6 integration: the editor menu opens the current script in the AutoJs6 editor (the designer reloads after AutoJs6 saves), imports it into the AutoJs6 script directory, or exports it anywhere; the designer also opens .js files directly from the AutoJs6 editor or a file manager and saves back into the same file, falling back to a new project without write access; project files are shared through the plugin's own content provider with per-request grants and no other directory is exposed
* `Improvement` The app title, plugin ID (three-block-compose), package and component names, release artifacts, documentation and the GitHub repository (AutoJs6-Plugin-Three-Block-Compose) follow the rename; the compose script API, the contract version and the rendering behavior are unchanged
* `Improvement` The launcher, plugin center and system App info icons now use the maintainer's final artwork, with the light and dark glyphs sharing one shape
* `Improvement` The bundled examples and the host example category are renamed to 3-Block Compose
* `Improvement` The compose-ui-api contract AAR is now packaged with the plugin and kept intact (previously compile-only) for the plugin's own process; inside AutoJs6 the host's identical contract classes still take precedence, so rendering behavior and the contract version are unchanged
* `Dependency` Add the slim Rhino parser jar (org.mozilla.javascript 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT, MPL 2.0, the same build as the AutoJs6 host), used only by the visual designer to parse scripts, never to run them; release builds keep only the referenced parser classes

# v1.1.0

###### 2026/10/08

* `Hint` 1.1.0 local development preview: use a matching AutoJs6 host build and the installed, enabled plugin. UI pages, floating windows, five examples, companion API reference and TypeScript declarations are provided for this local integration. Verified compatibility and performance scope is recorded in the roadmap. The plugin is not in the official index and has no official release. Current icon artwork is temporary, awaiting the maintainer's source images
* `Hint` This build uses Compose UI contract V2 and requires the matching AutoJs6 6.8.0 / 5322 host; companion TSX support requires TypeScript Engine 0.6.7. New hosts still support existing components in older V1 renderers; extended components require a V2 renderer
* `Hint` compose.memo is provided by AutoJs6 6.8.0 / 5323 to reuse render fragments whose dependencies are unchanged; this plugin needs no update, and companion TSX support requires TypeScript Engine 0.6.8
* `Hint` The gallery and settings run in the plugin process and change neither in-host rendering nor the minimum host version; running example scripts requires AutoJs6 with this plugin installed and enabled
* `Feature` TSX supports `<compose.Column>`, `<compose:Text>`, references to node factories, fragments, slots and reactive callbacks; a single tree cannot mix Compose and legacy XML nodes
* `Feature` XML `<compose>` containers and compose.attach embed independent Compose sessions in UI pages or legacy floating windows; compose.AndroidView embeds an existing Android View or one returned by a synchronous factory
* `Feature` compose.dialog returns an updatable, closable session for dialogs and modal bottom sheets in UI or ordinary scripts
* `Feature` Material 3 extended components: navigation bars and drawers, tabs, bottom sheets and menus, date and time pickers, paging and grids, chips, badges, segmented buttons, floating action buttons, search bars, tooltips and pull to refresh
* `Feature` Component gallery: open it from the launcher to browse Material 3 previews and example scripts of all 55 components, copy them to the clipboard or send them to the installed AutoJs6
* `Feature` Settings page: language, dark mode and theme color follow AutoJs6 by default and can be set separately; the launcher icon offers adaptive (light / dark / automatic) and transparent background choices
* `Fix` Fixed build failures after adjusting launcher icon backgrounds in Icon Studio
* `Improvement` Android App info icons share Icon Studio artwork and light/dark backgrounds while preserving transparent Plugin Center artwork and existing launcher choices
* `Improvement` View factories run on the main thread before rendering. Invalid replacements preserve the current content; a View cannot belong to two nodes or be taken from another parent. Borrowed Views retain their listeners and caller-owned resources
* `Improvement` cancelable=false disables back, outside-click and swipe dismissal; explicit close and script exit still release the dialog while preserving existing pages and other sessions
* `Improvement` The Plugin Center icon and the system app info icon use the #FAFAFA light / #212121 dark backgrounds shared with the other standalone plugins
* `Dependency` Update compose-ui-api.aar with the optional AndroidView interop extension while preserving frozen V1
* `Dependency` Add the optional dialog capability to compose-ui-api.aar while preserving existing V1 and AndroidView contracts
* `Dependency` Add the compose-ui-api.aar V2 component catalog while preserving existing node models and V1 component semantics
* `Dependency` Added material-color-utilities 4.1.1 (MIT) for the theme color derivation shared with the other standalone plugins
* `Dependency` Added host-locked copies of AndroidX activity, core, lifecycle, savedstate, emoji2, window, kotlinx-coroutines and their companions for the gallery in the plugin process; inside the host the host copies still take precedence

# v1.0.0

###### 2026/10/03

* `Hint` 1.0.0 local development preview: use a matching AutoJs6 host build and the installed, enabled plugin. UI pages, floating windows, five examples, companion API reference and TypeScript declarations are provided for this local integration. Verified compatibility and performance scope is recorded in the roadmap. The plugin is not in the official index and has no official release. Current icon artwork is temporary, awaiting the maintainer's source images
* `Hint` Requires AutoJs6 6.8.0 (5316) or later
* `Hint` Packaged apps also require a separately installed compatible Compose UI plugin, with enablement/authorization belonging to that app; compatibility checks the embedded AutoJs6 runtime, not the packaged app's own versionCode
* `Hint` The light/dark mipmap entries are retained; current artwork is a placeholder until the maintainer supplies the final black-and-white images
* `Feature` Callable compose / $compose with retained node handles, reactive state/render/ref, batched changes, queued posts and theme control
* `Feature` Material 3 core: 29 node factories for layouts, text, icons, images, buttons, inputs, selection controls, lazy lists, dialogs and progress; Snackbar is a session command, not a compose.Snackbar factory
* `Feature` UI scripts mount Activity content; compose.floaty also supports non-UI scripts with raw or resizable windows, pixel geometry, touch/focus controls and owned cleanup
* `Feature` All 20 modifier operations preserve declaration order, with layout scope checks, scrolling, and accessibility labels
* `Feature` Material 3 themes support seed colors, light and dark modes, Android 12+ system dynamic colors, font families, and text scaling
* `Feature` Native text editing preserves selection and IME composition, supports focus and explicit edits, and rejects delayed edits that would overwrite newer input; switches and sliders remain script-controlled
* `Feature` Core icons and ImageWrapper/Bitmap, local file and host drawable images; caller-owned image resources are not automatically recycled by the renderer
* `Feature` Five runnable examples for a counter, form validation, a keyed 1000-item list, a non-UI floating HUD, and themes, with prerequisites and an index, synchronized to the matching host's Compose UI sample category
* `Feature` Companion API reference and TypeScript declarations, plus README, plugin-center instructions and changelog in 10 languages
* `Feature` Plugin-center discovery with host-version, contract and authorization checks, without a standalone screen or launcher entry
* `Fix` Compose UI rejects mounting another page or floating window inside a render callback and keeps the current page; pages can be mounted again after plugin updates
* `Improvement` Availability probes and ComposeError consistently report missing, disabled, unauthorized or incompatible plugins, permission failures and closed sessions; lifecycle cleanup also covers windows canceled before native attachment; Updating, uninstalling or disabling the plugin closes its active sessions and reports the corresponding error
* `Dependency` Attach common-plugin-api.aar version 6.8.0 (5307) (MPL 2.0, hash-locked)
* `Dependency` Attach Jetpack Compose BOM 2026.09.00 (Apache 2.0)
* `Dependency` Attach compose-ui-api.aar V1 aligned to AutoJs6 6.8.0 (5316) (MPL 2.0, hash-locked), with shared dependencies aligned to the host
* `Dependency` Attach Compose UI Test managed by BOM 2026.09.00 (Apache 2.0, tests only)
* `Dependency` Attach JaCoCo version 0.8.14 (optional test coverage only, excluded from release packages)
